<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi! I'm Harsh, an <b>software developer and engineer</b>  currently in my third year of Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering at AIT Pune. I'm passionate about building impactful projects that blend creativity with technology.
</p>

<p>
  Over the past few years, I've been exploring web development, data structures & algorithms, and problem-solving, and I'm steadily working toward becoming a well-rounded full-stack developer. I enjoy learning new technologies, tackling challenging problems, and turning ideas into working solutions.
</p>

<p>
  Beyond academics, I'm curious, disciplined, and always eager to grow â€” whether it's by contributing to projects, collaborating with peers, or improving my technical and soft skills. My goal is to keep evolving as a developer and eventually contribute to building products that make a real difference in people's lives.
